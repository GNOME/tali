summary: Roll dice and score points
description: |
  A variation on poker with dice and less money, this game is a family classic.
  Throw the dice three times in a row, holding back the ones you like, in order
  to make the best possible hand. You can also play a lesser-known variant with
  colored dice.

  Play between one and five opponents at three difficulty levels.
