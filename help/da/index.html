</a>

<p>
Gnome tali er en slags poker med
terninger and less money.  You roll five dice three times and try to create
the best &quot;hand.&quot;  Your two rerolls may include any or all of your
dice.
</p>

<p>
Gnome Tali is very similar to terninge spillet Yahtzee, hvilket er et varemærke
tilhørende Hasbro, Inc.

<p>
When play starts, you see the results of your first throw of the dice.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the dice you wish to roll again and they will turn into
	   pumpkins -- thanks Tigert :)
  <li>When you have selected all the dice you wish to reroll, press
	  the &quot;Roll!&quot; button.
  <li>When you have a hand you like or have run out of chances to
	   throw the dice, click on a row corresponding to what you think
	   is your best scoring combination.  It is very possible to have
	   a score of zero and if you click on the wrong row, you
	   will be scored accordingly. (Say for example, you get
	   yahtzee -- 5 of a kind -- and click on the large straight row,
	   you will receive a zero in your large straigt score).
</ol>
</p>

<p>
You can only use each combination once, i.e. once you've entered
something in a slot, you can't change the score later if you roll a
better hand.
