    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
       <application>Gnome Tali</application> is a sort of poker with
       dice and less money.  You roll five dice three times and try to
       create the best <quote>hand</quote>. Your two rerolls may include
       any or all of your dice.
    </para>
    <para>
      <application>Gnome Tali</application> is very similar to the
      dice game Yahtzee which is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc.
    </para>

    <para>
      To run <application>Gnome Tali</application>, select
      <menuchoice>
	<guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu>
	<guimenuitem>Gnome Tali</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      from the <guimenu>Main Menu</guimenu>, or type
      <command>gtali</command> on the command line.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>Gnome Tali</application> is included in the
      <filename>gnome-games</filename> package, which is part of the
      GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version
      &version; of <application>Gnome Tali</application>.

      When play starts, you see the results of your first throw of the
      dice.

        <listitem>
	  <para>When you have a hand you like or have run out of chances
          to throw the dice, click on a row corresponding to what you think
          is your best scoring combination.  It is very possible to have
          a score of zero and if you click on the wrong row, you
          will be scored accordingly. (Say for example, you get
          yahtzee -- 5 of a kind -- and click on the large straight row,
          you will receive a zero in your large straight score).</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

    <para>You can only use each combination once, i.e. once you've entered
      something in a slot, you can't change the score later if you roll a
      better hand.
