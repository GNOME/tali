    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
       <application>GNOME Tali</application> is a sort of poker with
       dice and less money.  You roll five dice three times and try to
       create the best <quote>hand</quote>. Your two rerolls may include
       any or all of your dice.
    </para>
    <para>
      <application>GNOME Tali</application> is very similar to the
      dice game Yahtzee which is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>GNOME Tali</application> is included in the

    <para>
      When play starts, you see the results of your first throw of the
      dice.      
    </para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Click on the dice you wish to roll again and they will
            turn into pumpkins. Thanks Tigert :)
	  </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>When you have selected all the dice you wish to reroll,
            press the <guibutton>Roll!</guibutton> button.
	  </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>When you have a hand you like or have run out of chances
          to throw the dice, click on a row corresponding to what you think
          is your best scoring combination.  It is very possible to have
          a score of zero and if you click on the wrong row, you
          will be scored accordingly. (Say for example, you get
          yahtzee -- 5 of a kind -- and click on the large straight row,
          you will receive a zero in your large straight score).</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>You can only use each combination once, i.e. once you've entered
      something in a slot, you can't change the score later if you roll a
      better hand.
    </para>

    <para>There is one exception to this rule, if you roll a yahtzee a
     second time you can put it in the yahtzee row again for an extra
     fifty points. You can keep doing this each time you get another
     yahtzee. At the end of the game you will be given extra rolls to
     fill in the other rows. Be warned that if you score zero in your
     yahtzee row (i.e. you filled that row with something that wasn't
     a yahtzee) then you can't put a yahtzee in afterward, zero is all
     you will score.
    </para>

    <para>There is also a bonus of 35 points if you score a total of
    63 points or more in the top six rows.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="keyboard">
    <title>Using the keyboard</title> 

      <para>As an alternative to using the mouse, the keys 1 through 5
    toggle the dice just as if you had clicked them. The key 1
    corresponds to the first die and so on. Use the usual controls to
    roll the dice and select a row. i.e. use tab to switch between the
    roll button and the score area, use the arrow keys to navigate up
    and down the rows and use space to select.</para>

      <para>The 63 points needed for the bonus in the upper half
      corresponds to getting three of each die type in each row. If
      you score more than three dice in the fives and sixes rows then
      you can afford to place a bad roll in either the ones row or the
      twos row and still get the bonus.
      </para>
      <para>Don't forget about multiple yahtzees, if you roll a second
       yahtzee you can also put it in the yahtzee row for even more points.
