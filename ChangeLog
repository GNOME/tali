2003-05-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

2003-05-08  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* pix/gnome-dice-?.xpm: Reduced the colours used by each image to

	purpose of the bonus clearer. Also reworked the label. Fixes bug
	#92801.

	and the upper bonus. Fixes bug #109663 and helps toward bug
	#92801.

	* gyahtzee.c (say): Fixed buffer overflow possibilities when this
	function was called with a %s modifier (a long player name would
	demonstrate this by crashing the program). Fixes bug #74746.

2003-04-25  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* yahtzee.c: Removed HumansAreDone() function since it was
	deprecated long ago.

	* yahtzee.h: Removed HumansAreDone() prototype.

	* gyahtzee.c (NextPlayer): Rewrote the code that chooses the
	next player so it works correctly when there are extra turns due to

	* gtali.schemas.in: Fix the file, the <default> was in the wrong
	location.

2002-11-22  Tim Musson  <trmusson@ihug.co.nz>

	static. Also stop passing it around via the menu callbacks.

	* setup.c (setup_game): Set the relevant hints so that the setup
	dialog actually behaves like a dialog, not a window.
	
2002-06-03  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gyahtzee.c: Set the about window as a transient for the
	top-level window.

	* setup.c (setup_game): The preferences dialog should not appear
	under the mouse, but should state that it is a transient for the
	parent window.

2002-05-05  Chris Lyttle <chris@wilddev.net>

	* help/C/Makefile.am: updated for new format of SK 0.3.8.

	* gyahtzee.h: Use new prototypes from clist.c.
	* clist.c: Convert to GtkTreeView/GtkListStore.
	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add -D{G,GDK,GTK}_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

2002-04-25  Andreas Persenius  <ndap@telia.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* gyathzee.c: (LoadDicePixmaps): Use GtkImage instead of GnomePixmap
	and g_file_test() instead of g_file_exists().
	* setup.c: (WarnNumPlayersChanged): Use GtkMessageDialog instead of
	GnomeMessageBox.

	This makes GTali compile with -DGNOME_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.

2002-04-15  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gyahtzee.c: (about): nice icon, oooh
	* setup.c: (setup_game): use stock buttons, and add more space inside
	the frames

2002-04-15  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	Raise obstructed settings window when reselect prefs menu.

2000-06-06  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@po.cwru.edu>

	* setup.c (do_setup): Move player rename into setup dialog and 
	remove hook from clist.c

2000-05-12  Andreas Hyden  <a.hyden@cyberpoint.se>

	* gtali.desktop: Added Swedish translation.

2000-05-09  Martin Baulig  <baulig@suse.de>

1999-08-09  Robert Brady  <rwb197@ecs.soton.ac.uk

	* clist.c : applied Irix compiling fix from David Kaelbling 
	  <drk@sgi.com> : [bug #1781].

1999-04-18  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* NoGnome/Makefile.in: Update to reference config.h.in

	* NoGnome/config.h.in: rename from acconfig.h

	* scores.c (update_scorefile): Make sure to allocate scall if
	HAVE_RENAME fails.

1999-04-10  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* clist.c (ShowoffPlayer): Setting the column heading buttons to
	active/passive seems to force a redraw.  Leave as passive always. 

	* Allow change of player names under gnome.

	* *.c & *.h: Set default emacs tab width to 8 :)
	             Also clean out unused #if's
	
	* Add & populate help directory.

1999-03-29  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pix/gnome-gtali.png: Replaced the icon with one that matches
	better with the style of the rest of the desktop.. (all respect
	for the original artist)

1999-02-14  Ian Peters  <ipeters@acm.org>

	* Name changed to GTali

1999-01-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gyahtzee.c: Kill file menu.

1999-01-10  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* gyahtzee.c (GyahtzeeCreateMainWindow): Create a GnomeAppBar, not
 	a GtkStatusBar.  Installed menu hints.
	(say): Use the appbar.

	Standardized the menus.

Mon Nov 23 16:58:42 EST 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* clist.c : commented out the gtk_clist_set_policy function as
	gtk 1.1.5 don't have it anymore.
	This has been 'guarded' by a FIXME :)

1998-10-24  Tuomas Kuosmanen  <tigert@gimp.org>

	* pix/gnome-dice-*.xpm: Got into artistic mood and made some dice pics
	I hope you like them ;)

1998-10-18  Phil Schwan  <pschwan@cmu.edu>

	* clist.c (select_row): This function is now called for both select and
	unselect events.  It takes care of making sure that the row is actually
	being selected/unselected, etc.  This takes care of the problem of
	having to de-select and then re-select rows in multi-player games.
	* (create_clist): Added unselect_row callback.

	* gyahtzee.c: (NextPlayer): The old way of doing things would cause a
	deadlock if player 2 had more yahtzees than player 1.
	* (gnome_modify_dice): Added a DEBUG mode that allows the player to
	shift-click on dice and change their values.  Was useful in testing the
	deadlock fix.
	* Added some "void"s and some "static"s so that it compiles
	-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes clean.

	* yahtzee.c (play_score): The special case for yahtzees was broken,
	never checking to see if the user actually had a yahtzee before
	allowing them to use the slot twice--this allowed the user to click on
	yahtzee any time they didn't like their roll, as long as they'd already
	rolled a yahtzee earlier in the game.
	* (HumansAreDone): commented out this function, as it's no longer
	needed because of the change to gyahtzee.c

	* yahtzee.h: removed HumansAreDone prototype.

1998-07-25  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* gyahtzee.desktop: Added Portuguese translation.

	* yahtzee.c, computer.c, clist.c: Some internationalization work. 

Tue Jul  7 15:52:29 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* yahtzee.c: Add RegisterUndo() and ExecSingleUndo() allowing undo
	of last round.  Cheater flag is activated and high scores will not
	be saved.  Undo only available in gnome version.

Sun Jun 28 19:08:55 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@po.cwru.edu>

	* Summary:
	1) Allow 0-6 humans to play, limit total players to 6
	2) Fix scoring of multiple yahtzee's
	3) Hack that adjusts column header to indicate current player
	4) Comment call to gnome_message_box_new() until fixed in libs.

	* gyahtzee.c (gnome_modify_dice): don't let player un/select dice
	after game is over.
	* (NextPlayer): Make computers keep playing after humans are done.
	* (GyahtzeeNewGame): Allow 0 humans, when new game is started,
	computers will play to end of game.
	* (CheerWinner): Allow any one human to get a recordable high
 	score.  Should check all of the scores and see which are high, but
 	now, only check the high score.
	* (play_score): Fix code for multiple yahtzees.  Now have to make
 	sure all computers are allowed extra turns, even if human is done.
	* (HumansAreDone): Add new function to detect when only computers
 	are remaining.

	* clist.c (select_row): don't let player select score row if game
	over.  Use better #define's for row numbers we can't select.
	Trouble for multiple players if they want to score in the row that
	is already highlighted.
	* (create_clist): Remove unused callbacks.
	* (ShowoffPlayer): Rename Higlight and Unhiglight functions to
 	ShowoffPlayer.  Add some hacks that would be illegal under C++ to
 	mess with gtk internals to press buttons to indicate current
 	player.

	* setup.c (do_setup): Only display player change warning if number
	of players is changed.  Calling gnome_message_box_new() crashes my
	machine with a segv.
	* setup.c (MaxPlayersCheck): Synchronize num players/comp spinners
	to never exceede max players.
	* Add options for multiple humans.  High score is scored under the
 	login name of the user running gyahtzee.  It's hard to keep track
 	of who's up too, pay attention to "* -- you're up" in status box.

	* cyahtzee.c: Add NLS support.


Fri Jun 26 17:26:49 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* gyahtzee.c (main): Warned gnome_client_new_default is obsolet. 
 	Removed all refs to it, just rely on gnome_init() to do all the
	work.

	* gyahtzee.c/setup.c/clist.c: Update callback functions to return
 	gints.  I am still unsure about returning TRUE/FALSE.  I've
 	handled the events, so I should return TRUE but maybe some other
 	routine will handle button/menu cleanup if I return FALSE.
	

Fri Jun 26 14:42:22 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@po.cwru.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Add cyahtzee back in as conditional build
	* cyahtzee.c/h: update names of defines to match curses.m4

1998-06-26  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (cyahtzee): Disable until Curses is properly
	autoconfed. 
	(Pixmap_DATA): Move to ...
	* pix/Makefile.am: ... here.

1998-06-25  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* setup.c (setup_game): Conditionally use new GtkSpinButton API.
	Fixes Maciej's FIXME too.

1998-06-25  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* setup.c (setup_game): FIXME: enums do _not_ result in the
	members of the enumeration being #defined, at least on gcc, so the
	`#ifdef GTK_UPDATE_SNAP_TO_TICKS' test is bogus.  Leaving only the
	case that works on gtk+-1.0.4; is it worth supporting earlier
	gtk's than that?

Wed Jun 24 22:25:48 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* Commit to CVS.

	* cyahtzee.c: Add color support.  gets->fgets.  Try to maintain
	backward compatibilty with very old curses if NOCOLORCURSES defined.

	* setup.c (setup_game): GTK_UPDATE_SNAP_TO_TICKS has dissapeared
	in CVS - noticed & patch by Jaka Mocnik.  Should probably just
	toss the old way, but leave for now in case anyone is using an old
	snapshot.
	

Sun Jun 21 15:06:24 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* gyahtzee.c (ShowPlayer): Add bonus to upper total - that's where
	zorst had it, but should it just go directly into grand total?

	* Release version 980621a 
        (980621 had probs w/Build script and missing config.h)

	* add Build script - cleaner than makefile to determine gnome
	setup on an unknown machine?

	* computer.c:
	  * remove be_computer()
	  * Forgot to call RollSelectedDice() for each computer roll
	  * Remove refs to global CurrentPlayer, each function should use
	    value passed as parameter player

	* gyahtzee.c / pix dir: update names inside xpm files to reflect
	new names (gnome-dice-N.xpm), fix check for missing pixmap files -
	will now use any pixmap files it finds, but fallback to compiled
	in pixmaps.

	* cyahtzee.c, cyahtzee.h: Add basic curses support - using zorst's
 	original version.  Will go back and add color hacks later.

	* scores.c, scores.h: Curses version has own routines for dealing
	with highscores.

Thu Jun 18 12:53:32 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* gyahtzee.c (GyahtzeeCreateMainWindow): Put eventbox around
	pixmaps which 1) makes it easier to select the X
	pixmap, and 2) gets rid of the flicker on the menubar when we
	unhide each pixmap for the first time.

	* gyahtzee.c: add entries for keyboard accelerators 

Wed Jun 17 23:00:00 1998  Scott D. Heavner  <sdh@fishmonger.dont.mail.me.here.net>

	* Release version 980617
	

*Local Variables:
*backup-inhibited: t
*End:
